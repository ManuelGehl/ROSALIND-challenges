# Clump Finding

This repository contains a Python solution for the Clump Finding Problem. The problem involves identifying specific patterns within a DNA sequence, known as clumps, where a pattern appears at least a certain number of times within a specified interval.

## Solution Overview

The solution comprises several utility functions designed to efficiently address the Clump Finding Problem:

- `pattern_frequency`: Calculates the frequency of patterns within a DNA sequence.
- `pattern_count`: Counts occurrences of a pattern within a sequence.
- `filter_frequencies`: Filters a dictionary of pattern frequencies based on a specified occurrence threshold.
- `find_clumps`: Identifies clumped patterns within a DNA sequence using a filtered dictionary of pattern frequencies.
