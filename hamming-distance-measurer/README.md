# DNA Mutation Measurer

## Overview

The DNA Mutation Measurer is a Python script that measures the Hamming distance between two DNA sequences read from a file. 
The Hamming distance is the number of positions at which corresponding symbols (characters) are different between the two sequences. 
This project includes a `MutationMeasurer` class with methods to read sequences from a file and calculate the Hamming distance.

## Usage

The script accepts a text file ("data.txt") with two simple DNA (or RNA) sequences in each line.
It then simply prints out the Hamming distance for that pair of sequences as it runs.
