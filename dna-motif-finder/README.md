The MotifFinder class is a Python script designed for finding a motif within a given DNA sequence. 
It provides a simple and efficient way to identify the starting positions of a specified motif in a DNA sequence and save the results to an output file.

## Input

The script takes input from a file (default: data.txt) which should contain two lines:
- The DNA sequence.
- The motif to be found in the DNA sequence.

## Output

The script outputs the starting positions of the motif in the DNA sequence to a file (default: result.txt).
