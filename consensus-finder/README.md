# ConsensusFinder

The ConsensusFinder class is a Python script designed for reading multiple DNA sequences from a FASTA file, computing the profile matrix, and determining the consensus sequence. 
It provides a comprehensive analysis of a set of DNA sequences, summarizing the most prevalent nucleotide at each position and generating a consensus sequence.
